Sure! Here’s a detailed step-by-step breakdown from pre-development to release, arranged in the correct logical order.

1. Spark Cluster Sizing Calculation

(Already covered in the previous response, keeping it unchanged)


---

2. Pre-Development Setup (Before Coding Starts)

Step 1: Infrastructure Provisioning

✅ Set up a scalable Spark cluster on Kubernetes, AWS EMR, Databricks, or standalone VMs.
✅ Configure SFTP servers (mock or real) for testing.
✅ Define NAS/HDFS/S3 storage locations for temporary file storage.
✅ Set up Kafka / Message Queue if required for event-driven workflows.
✅ Implement Secrets Management using AWS Secrets Manager / Vault for storing:

SFTP credentials

API keys

PGP encryption keys



---

Step 2: CI/CD Pipeline Setup

✅ Version Control: Set up GitHub/GitLab repository.
✅ Automated Build Process: Define a pipeline in Jenkins / GitHub Actions to:

Build and package Spark jobs.

Validate configurations for different environments.
✅ Artifact Management: Use AWS S3, Nexus, or JFrog to store compiled Spark jobs.
✅ Automated Deployment Scripts for Dev → QA → Prod environments.



---

Step 3: Development of Monitoring, Logging & Alerting Framework

✅ Set up log aggregation using ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) / Prometheus.
✅ Implement real-time monitoring dashboards for:

File download and upload status

Processing time for each stage

API call success/failures
✅ Set up alerts in Grafana / CloudWatch / Prometheus for:

Job failures

High processing latency

SFTP connection failures



---

Step 4: Automated Regression Suite for Spark Jobs

✅ Unit Tests: Use Pytest + PySpark Testing Framework for:

Download module

Unzip & metadata extraction

PGP encryption

Upload module
✅ Integration Tests: Mock SFTP, REST API, and run end-to-end workflows.
✅ Load Testing: Simulate multiple partners to check Spark cluster auto-scaling.
✅ Chaos Testing: Inject failures (e.g., API timeout, disk failure) and observe system resilience.



---

3. Development (Build) Steps

Step 5: File Download Module

✅ Develop SFTP connector using pysftp with ThreadPoolExecutor.
✅ Implement retries for failed downloads.
✅ Store files in NAS/HDFS/S3 after download.


---

Step 6: File Unzipping Module

✅ Support multiple compression formats (.zip, .gz, .tar).
✅ Process in parallel using Spark’s distributed execution.


---

Step 7: Metadata Extraction & API Integration

✅ Use PySpark DataFrame to calculate:

File size

Record count
✅ Call third-party REST API with extracted metadata.
✅ Implement error handling and retries for API failures.



---

Step 8: File Encryption Module

✅ Encrypt files using python-gnupg with the provided public key.
✅ Implement PGP encryption validation before uploading.


---

Step 9: File Upload Module

✅ Use pysftp with 9 parallel threads per partner for uploads.
✅ Verify upload integrity before marking the process as complete.


---

Step 10: Implement Spark Job Orchestration

✅ Use Apache Airflow or AWS Step Functions for:

Job scheduling

Error handling & retries

Dependency management (ensuring processing completes before uploads start)



---

4. Release Process in Spark Tech Stack

Step 11: Deployment Strategy

✅ Dev Deployment: Small Spark cluster (1-2 nodes) for testing.
✅ QA Deployment: 4-node Spark cluster for integration tests.
✅ Prod Deployment: Scale to 2N worker nodes based on partners.


---

Step 12: Blue-Green Deployment for Zero Downtime

✅ Deploy a new version in a separate cluster.
✅ Run sanity tests on the new cluster.
✅ Switch traffic to the new version once validated.


---

Step 13: Post-Deployment Monitoring & Optimization

✅ Monitor logs via ELK or CloudWatch.
✅ Check job processing time and optimize Spark configurations.
✅ Implement auto-scaling for adding new partners dynamically.


---

Final Summary

1. Spark Cluster Sizing Formula

\text{Worker Nodes} = 2N, \quad \text{Executors} = 4N, \quad \text{Total Cores} = 8N, \quad \text{Total RAM} = 32N \text{ GB}

2. Pre-Development Setup

✅ Infrastructure provisioning (Spark Cluster, SFTP, HDFS/S3, Secrets Management)
✅ CI/CD Pipeline Setup (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Deployment Automation)
✅ Monitoring, Logging, and Alerting Setup (ELK, Prometheus, Grafana, Alerts)
✅ Automated Regression Suite (Unit, Integration, Load, Chaos Testing)

3. Development Tasks

✅ File Processing Pipeline (Download, Unzip, Metadata, Encrypt, Upload)
✅ Spark Job Orchestration with Apache Airflow
✅ Unit & Integration Testing

4. Release Process

✅ Deploy to Dev → QA → Prod
✅ Use Blue-Green Deployment
✅ Post-Deployment Monitoring & Auto-scaling
