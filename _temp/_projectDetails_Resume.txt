This project focuses on managing marketing offers for credit card users, enabling targeted promotions and personalized rewards. It includes a comprehensive lifecycle from campaign creation, offer setup, targeting, and advertisement to user redemption and reward processing. The system integrates with an external aggregator via an API and file engine for offer ingestion and transaction data exchange.
