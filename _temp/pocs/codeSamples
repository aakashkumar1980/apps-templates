To control the specific partition number dynamically and ensure that the id value directly maps to a corresponding partition (i.e., id = 1 maps to partition 1, id = 2 maps to partition 2, and so on), you can adjust the custom partition assignment logic to directly use the id for mapping.

Key Adjustments:

1. Direct Mapping: When assigning partitions, you directly map the id value to the partition. For instance, id = 1 maps to partition = 1, id = 2 maps to partition = 2, etc.


2. Ensure Valid Partition Numbers: The id needs to match a valid partition number. If the number of partitions in the topic is less than the id, you can either reject the assignment or wrap the id to fit within the available partitions (e.g., by using modulo).



Updated CustomPartitionAssignor Implementation:

public class CustomPartitionAssignor implements ConsumerPartitionAssignor {

    private Integer id;

    // Constructor that accepts the dynamic 'id'
    public CustomPartitionAssignor(Integer id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    @Override
    public List<PartitionAssignor.Assignment> assign(List<PartitionAssignor.Subscription> subscriptions) {
        List<PartitionAssignor.Assignment> assignments = new ArrayList<>();

        // Iterate through the subscriptions to assign partitions dynamically based on 'id'
        for (PartitionAssignor.Subscription subscription : subscriptions) {
            List<TopicPartition> topicPartitions = new ArrayList<>();
            String topic = subscription.topic();

            // Get the number of partitions for the topic
            int numPartitions = subscription.partitions().size();

            // Ensure 'id' is within the range of available partitions
            // If the id is greater than the number of partitions, use modulo to fit the id into the range
            int partition = (id - 1) % numPartitions;  // id starts from 1, so we subtract 1

            // Directly map the 'id' to the partition number
            topicPartitions.add(new TopicPartition(topic, partition));

            // Create an assignment for the pod based on the calculated partition
            assignments.add(new PartitionAssignor.Assignment(topicPartitions));
        }

        return assignments;
    }

    @Override
    public String name() {
        return "CustomPartitionAssignor";
    }
}

Key Logic Explained:

Mapping id to Partition: In this implementation, the id directly corresponds to the partition number. For example, id = 1 maps to partition = 0 (as partitioning starts from 0). If id starts from 1, we subtract 1 to ensure the proper partition mapping.

Modulo Handling: The modulo operation (id - 1) % numPartitions ensures that if the id exceeds the available partitions, it wraps around (i.e., id = 5 with numPartitions = 3 would map to partition 2). You can adjust this logic if you want to prevent the wrapping behavior.


Consumer Configuration:

Make sure the consumer uses this custom partition assignor in its configuration, passing the id dynamically:

// Retrieve the pod-specific ID dynamically (e.g., from your DB call)
Integer id = idService.getId();  // Get the unique pod ID, e.g., 1, 2, etc.

// Create a custom partition assignor instance with the retrieved 'id'
CustomPartitionAssignor customAssignor = new CustomPartitionAssignor(id);

Properties properties = new Properties();
properties.put("bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092");
properties.put("group.id", "my-consumer-group");
properties.put("enable.auto.commit", "false");
properties.put("key.deserializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer");
properties.put("value.deserializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer");
properties.put("partition.assignment.strategy", customAssignor.getClass().getName());

KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(properties);
consumer.subscribe(Collections.singletonList("my-topic"));

Additional Considerations:

1. Validating Partition Existence: Ensure that the id provided by your system doesnâ€™t exceed the number of partitions available in the Kafka topic. If the id is larger than the available partitions, you can either:

Reject the assignment or throw an exception if the id is invalid.

Use the modulo logic to map the id to a valid partition, as demonstrated above.



2. Scaling: As more pods are deployed, each one should have a unique id that directly corresponds to a Kafka partition.



This solution ensures that the id value from your database is used directly to assign a partition to each pod. The id = 1 will map to partition 0, id = 2 will map to partition 1, and so on, with modulo logic for cases when the id exceeds the available partitions.
