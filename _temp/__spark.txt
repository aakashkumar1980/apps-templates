Here’s a structured approach, including Spark cluster calculations, pre-development setup, development tasks, and release process:


---

1. Spark Cluster Sizing Calculation

Understanding the Constraints

Each partner has:

8 parallel connections for file download.

9 parallel connections for file upload.

5 minutes for each download or upload operation.

Processing (unzip, metadata extraction, encryption) must be 30% faster than the download/upload time to prevent bottlenecks.


Since upload/download takes 5 minutes each, we set a processing time limit of:

\frac{5}{1.3} \approx 3.85 \text{ minutes (≈4 minutes)}


---

1.1 Cluster Calculation for One Partner

A. Number of Processing Slots Required

Each partner has 8 files downloading at any moment and 9 files uploading.
Thus, the number of files in intermediate processing at a time = 8 (files just downloaded and being processed).

Since processing must be completed in 4 minutes, the cluster must process 8 files every 4 minutes.


---

B. Spark Task Parallelism & Executors Calculation

Assume:

Each Spark executor handles 2 files in parallel.

Each worker node has 4 cores and 16 GB RAM.

Each task requires 2 cores and 4 GB RAM (as it involves CPU-intensive PGP encryption and network I/O).


So, for one partner:

Executors required:


\frac{8 \text{ (parallel processing files)}}{2 \text{ (files per executor)} } = 4 \text{ executors}

\frac{4 \text{ executors} \times 2 \text{ cores}}{4 \text{ cores per node}} = 2 \text{ nodes}

Thus, for one partner, we need 2 worker nodes (4 executors, 8 cores, 16GB per node).


---

1.2 Cluster Calculation for N Partners

Since all partners operate independently, the system scales linearly.

For N partners, we multiply the above calculations:

Executors required = 

Worker nodes required = 


Thus, the final cluster formula:

\text{Worker Nodes} = 2N, \quad \text{Executors} = 4N, \quad \text{Total Cores} = 8N, \quad \text{Total RAM} = 32N \text{ GB}


---

2. Pre-Development Setup (Before Coding Starts)

1. CI/CD Pipeline Setup

Implement CI/CD with Jenkins / GitHub Actions for Spark jobs.

Automate deployment to Dev, QA, and Prod environments.



2. Infrastructure Provisioning

Deploy a scalable Spark cluster (EMR, Kubernetes, or standalone Spark on VMs).

Setup SFTP connections for testing.

Define HDFS / S3 as a temporary storage layer.



3. Security and Secrets Management

Store SFTP credentials, API keys, and encryption keys in AWS Secrets Manager / HashiCorp Vault.



4. Monitoring & Logging

Set up ELK Stack / Prometheus for log aggregation.

Implement error alerts and dashboards for job monitoring.





---

3. Development (Build) Steps

Step 1: Develop Spark Processing Pipeline

Module 1: SFTP File Download

Use pysftp with ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel downloads.


Module 2: File Unzipping

Use gzip and tarfile for decompression.


Module 3: Metadata Extraction

Process using PySpark DataFrame and send results to the third-party API.


Module 4: PGP Encryption

Encrypt using python-gnupg.


Module 5: SFTP Upload

Reuse pysftp with 9 parallel threads per partner.




---

Step 2: Implement Spark Job Orchestration

Use Apache Airflow to schedule job execution.

Implement error handling and retries.



---

Step 3: Unit & Integration Testing

Use JUnit & Pytest for function-level tests.

Validate Spark job performance with sample files.



---

4. Release Process in Spark Tech Stack

Step 1: Deployment Strategy

Dev Environment: Deploy on local Spark / small EMR cluster.

QA Environment: Deploy on 4-node Spark cluster with integration testing.

Prod Environment: Deploy using N-scaled worker nodes (based on partner count).



---

Step 2: Blue-Green Deployment for Zero Downtime

Deploy the new version in a separate cluster.

Once validated, switch traffic to the new cluster.



---

Step 3: Post-Deployment Monitoring

Log monitoring in ELK / Prometheus.

Alerting system for failures.

Auto-scaling mechanism for increasing partners dynamically.



---

Final Summary
