1. Campaign Creation:

Purpose: A marketing campaign is created for a specific time (e.g., New Year) to promote offers and attract customers.

Budget Approval: A budget is approved to support the marketing initiatives for the campaign.



2. Offer Construction:

Initial Offer Design: The marketing team designs an offer (e.g., "Spend $100, get $20 cashback").

Approval Process: The offer is reviewed and approved by the marketing team before launching.



3. Offer Implementation:

System Integration: Once approved, the offer is integrated into your system and becomes available to customers.

Rollout: The offer is promoted through various advertising channels (e.g., email, social media) to ensure it reaches the target audience.





---

4. Offer Targeting:

Audience Identification: The offer is targeted towards a specific customer segment based on demographics, behavior, or past purchases.

Customizations: The offer may be customized to meet the preferences of specific user groups, ensuring higher relevance and engagement.


5. Offer Eligibility:

Criteria Definition: Eligibility criteria for customers to avail the offer are set (e.g., minimum spending amount, specific merchants, or products).

Eligibility Check: Customers are checked for eligibility based on the defined rules, ensuring only those who meet the requirements can redeem the offer.



6. Offer Impressions (Under Advertisement):

Advertising: The offer is advertised to the target audience using different channels (e.g., email campaigns, in-app promotions, social media ads).

Impression Tracking: The number of times the offer is viewed by users (impressions) is tracked to measure campaign reach and engagement.



7. Redemption:

Customer Action: Customers make qualifying purchases according to the offer’s terms (e.g., spending $100).

Offer Redemption: Once customers meet the criteria, they redeem the offer (e.g., receiving $20 cashback on their credit card).



8. Goal: The main objective is to maximize the number of transactions and offer redemptions during the campaign, ensuring the marketing initiative is a success.

9. Integration Layer: Aggregator Integration:

Aggregator Integration:

Offer Aggregation & Customization: The Aggregator aggregates offers from various sources and customizes them based on customer behavior and preferences.

Send Offers: These tailored offers are then sent to your system for approval and distribution.

10. System Components

API Engine (Real-Time Interaction & Integration):

Purpose: The API Engine acts as an interface to receive the customized offers from the Aggregator and also interacts with external systems.

APIGEE as the API Gateway:

Inbound API Calls: APIGEE is used as the API Gateway for handling inbound API calls to your system. It ensures that external clients or systems can securely and efficiently access your APIs to interact with your system.

Outbound API Proxy: APIGEE also acts as a proxy for outbound API calls made from your system to external services (e.g., sending customer data or offers to the Aggregator). This enables controlled, secure, and monitored communication between your system and external APIs.

Real-Time Integration: APIGEE ensures seamless real-time communication, handling API requests, responses, and any necessary transformations for data exchange.


Functionality: It processes and integrates incoming and outgoing API calls, facilitating the exchange of data with the Aggregator, customers, and other external services in real-time.


Use Cases for API Engine with APIGEE:

Receiving real-time offers and promotions from Aggregator.

Sending customer-specific data (e.g., transaction data, preferences) to Aggregator for offer customization.

Facilitating API-based communication with other systems in a secure and efficient manner.

Providing real-time availability of offers and data to customers and marketing systems.



---

File Engine (Batch Processing & Data Transfer):

Purpose: The file engine acts as a backend interface to transfer bulk data, such as customer transaction data and merchant details, between your system and Aggregator.

Functionality: It handles the transmission of large datasets in batch format, enabling the processing and tailoring of offers based on customer and merchant data.

Data Flow: Typically, the file engine processes data in bulk at scheduled intervals, allowing for more efficient data transfers.


Messaging Backbone with Kafka:

Kafka as the Backbone: Kafka is used as the messaging system to manage and stream data across different components in the File Engine processing.

Message Queues: Kafka handles message queues to ensure that the data (e.g., customer transaction data, merchant data, etc.) is processed in an orderly, fault-tolerant manner.

Real-Time Data Streaming: Kafka enables real-time streaming of data between systems, ensuring that the file engine can process large amounts of data quickly and reliably.

Scalability & Fault Tolerance: Kafka’s distributed nature ensures that the file engine can scale to handle increasing data volumes while maintaining resilience in case of failures.


Use Cases for Kafka in File Engine:

Message Queuing: Kafka queues messages for efficient batch processing, ensuring data is handled correctly and in sequence.

Real-Time Data Streaming: Kafka ensures the smooth transfer of large datasets like transaction data between systems for offer tailoring and campaign analysis.

Fault Tolerance & Scalability: Kafka allows the file engine to process high volumes of data reliably, with the system scaling automatically as the demand increases.

Kubernetes PODs for File Processing (Scalability & Resiliency):

Purpose: Kubernetes PODs are used to manage and handle the file processing tasks, ensuring better scalability, resiliency, and efficient management of batch data.

Distributed Processing: The file processing tasks are divided across multiple PODs to ensure parallel processing, allowing for improved throughput and quicker execution of batch jobs.

Resiliency: The use of multiple PODs enhances the system's resiliency. If one POD fails, others can continue processing, ensuring that file processing doesn't stop due to single points of failure.

Scalability: Kubernetes can scale the number of PODs dynamically based on the volume of data being processed. As the workload increases (e.g., during high transaction periods), additional PODs can be spun up automatically to handle the load.


Benefits of Kubernetes PODs for File Engine:

High Availability: Ensures that the file engine is always available, with minimal downtime, by distributing tasks across multiple PODs.

Scalability: Automatically adjusts the resources based on the volume of data, ensuring efficient batch processing even during peak periods.

Fault Tolerance: Ensures that even if a POD encounters an issue, other PODs can pick up the slack and continue processing, providing uninterrupted service.
